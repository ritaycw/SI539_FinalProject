          <h1>Come To The Rescue</h1>
          <p>We are a very small, independent rescue group that is run and supported by folks who are passionate about saving the lives of animals who have otherwise been 'thrown out'.<br>
            Most of our pets come from unfortunate situations which include being found as starving strays and from hoarding homes and high kill shelters. Additionally, we try our best to re-home animals (particularly seniors) whose elderly caretakers can no longer afford to keep them. As we are a very small group, we only take in as many pets as we can comfortably house within our own homes. This means that we do not practice 'warehousing animals in crates' as (sadly) some other groups do. We also try and keep the numbers low in our foster homes so that the animals being sheltered do not become stressed or ill due to overcrowded situations.</p>

          <h2>About Rescue</h2>
          <p>Many (but not all) of our pets often come to us bearing both physical and mental scars from their former lives. Some of these, as you can imagine, can be very extreme. But we do our very best to work with each animal individually in order to help them begin the healing process. This usually involves providing grooming, vetting, training and, most importantly, enormous amounts of both love and patience.<br>
            Because the only goal of our group is to continue to save/home animals in need, we do not ask for remittance beyond what we have spent on the animals for the above items. We will accept donations offered from families who would like to help us help our animals as long as they understand that -due to the fact that we are not a 501c3 organization- those donations can not be used as a tax write-off.</p>

          <h2>Care</h2>
          <p>Our vetting protocol follows the American Veterinary Medical Association Guidelines set out for both dogs (puppies) and cats(kittens). This includes all of the 'core' recommended vaccines and several of the 'non-core' ones as well. In addition to typical (and age appropriate) vaccines, we routinely worm our pets as well as keep them on regular heart worm/flea/tick medications in order to ensure that everyone remains as healthy as possible. We also work closely with our adopters to ensure that they complete vaccines or procedures that (due to age or illness) were not completed at the time of adoption.</p>
          <p>Our animals are housed in our homes and made to feel as though they are part of our family until they become adopted. And, for many, this is truly a novel experience. But it is made even more special when that ideal home is found and an otherwise discarded critter becomes a family's most devoted and lifelong companion.</p>

          <h2>Visits</h2>
          <p>Adopters are always welcome to visit our foster homes at any time when they are interested in our animals. We love having families come by and meeting the pets in a 'home environment' means that the animals are introduced to potential new owners from an area of comfort- as opposed to huddling in a crate in a pet store setting.<br>
            At Come To The Rescue we are devoted to our pets and we love watching shy/timid animals simply blossom in an atmosphere of friendliness, respect and love.</p>
